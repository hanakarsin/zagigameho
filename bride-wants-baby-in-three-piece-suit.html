It's not their fault, they can't help it. That's why their parents and guardians are there to clean them up and keep them protected, fed, and healthy so they can hopefully grow up and become people who aren't messy and who can contribute to their species by following their dreams and making themselves happy.</p><p>So it makes sense that the clothes designed for infants center more on function rather than form. But what's a child to wear if they're attending a wedding? At what age should a baby be put in a suit, dressing like they're a robber baron ready to put together a steel sale that'll revolutionize the country in ways that'll reshape cities and lift families from poverty and into the middle class?</p><p>According to an X user who goes by Mother Goose (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@motherofland</a>), there's a bride who believes that this age is 11 weeks old.</p><p>Everyone who's ever dealt with a bridezilla knows that in their wretched pursuit of convincing themselves that they're happily marrying the person they settled for, that everything needs to be absolutely "perfect" at their wedding, or else there will be no joy for anyone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What should an 11 week old wear to a black tie wedding?

Bride wants him to wear a full three-piece suit buuuuut I think that’s too much."</p><p>One X user had a suggestion for what a baby could wear in this type of scenario: "Honestly just a crisp white, black or plain onesie? Maybe a bowtie for a picture if you're feeling it. If it were my wedding I definitely wouldn't care."</p><p>To which Mother Goose replied: "If only it were that simple."</p><p>One joked: "What if he upstages the groom?"</p><p>To which Mother Goose remarked: "The groom is in a white suit! Baby will match the groomsmen and the officiant (my husband) with his black suit."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think it's inappropriate of your friend to make such strict demands about the attire of a baby. He's a BABY.</p>— Freely Ashley (@TheFreelyAshley) <a href=#>August 1, 2024</a></figure><p>Someone seemed to think that the cuteness factor alone would be worth putting a child in a very small suit: "My 8-month-old son wore a suit to my wedding and I promise you, you will regret not putting the tiny baby in the tiny suit. I cannot overstate the cuteness you are being asked to deliver, the joy the tiny suited baby will bring … and the pictures you’ll have forever of a wee gentleman."</p><p>Mother Goose stated that while they acknowledged how adorable this would be, it just wasn't a great idea for them to wholly embrace seeing as the child's comfort may ultimately be compromised as a result: "While I do agree there will be a cuteness overload, I cannot overstate how much I refuse to put an 11-week-old in pants, button down, waistcoat, bow tie and a jacket while also getting our daughter (the flower girl) ready plus myself."</p><p>One person recommended that Mother Goose simply dress up her child in a onesie fashioned to look like a tux: "There are tuxedo onesies. I'd go with that."</p><p>Mother Goose ended up sending a picture of one to the bride to see if she was down with this option: "Sent one to the bride and awaiting to see if it passed her approval."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Also in my (witnessing) experience to all of the readers out there- when you micromanage like this you’re basically setting yourself up for a stressful and not fun wedding day.</p>— Bridget Fondle (@BRIDGETFONDLE_) <a href=#>August 1, 2024</a> <span>Source: X | @BRIDGETFONDLE_)</span></figure><p>In a follow-up post, it seemed that the bride was not cool with the outfits that they were putting forth for the wedding: "Update: I sent her these two options (we already own) and said the first could be rehearsals and the other wedding day. She said they were fine for rehearsal dinner but still not wedding day worthy," Mother Goose wrote in another X post.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Update:<br>I sent her these two options (we already own) and said the first could be rehearsals and the other wedding day.

You're still doing 10 diaper changes a day at that age!" they wrote.</p><p>Mother Goose responded by stating: "That’s why I refuse to put him in a baby tux! I just want a one-piece with snaps. Not to mention if he spits up! Like he might have three outfit changes that day, who knows!!!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My own approach would be to just wrap them in a sheet until they stop outgrowing everything so quickly.</p>— Father Schmidt (@FrDarinSchmidt) <a href=#>August 1, 2024</a> <span>Source: X | @FrDarinSchmidt</span></figure><p>There was another X user who wrote that the mom's friend probably wasn't that good of a friend for how demanding they were being: "I don't want to be that person, but I think your friend is probably not much of a friend. It's a big ask for a mom of an 11-week-old baby to accommodate a bride through a baby's outfit. This is very strange and unusual."</p><p>Someone else made a pretty valid point however — if the baby's not in the wedding party or a focal point in pictures, then they really don't need to abide by any dress code: "Unless he’s in the wedding, you don’t have to ask or get approval. You can show up wearing whatever you want."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqsMRmrpqmpKh6o63BsmSipl2ptbOxxGanop2Tmnq0wcit</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chicago-west-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chicago West - Age, Family, Bio</a>
