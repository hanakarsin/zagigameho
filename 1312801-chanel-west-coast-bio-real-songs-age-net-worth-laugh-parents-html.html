They're not shows about my life or my music, or my struggle or anything like that. They're shows where you pretty much see me laughing and smiling all the time</li><li>Music is what I do pretty much all the time. I'm always in the studio. I'm always rehearsing for shows. Always doing shows.</li><li>You can have opinions, but it doesn't mean they're right.</li><li>I don't think a lot of people know what a real artist I am. I don't think they know I write my own music.</li><li>I would say Tupac influenced me the most to start rapping, but as far as a female icon that I've looked up to since I was six or seven is definitely Gwen Stefani.</li><li>I'd rather be busy, working non-stop, than being bored at home, you know?</li><li>My real, full name is Chelsea Chanel Dudley. In my opinion, Chelsea Dudley does not sound like a rapper. So I was like, 'You know what? Imma drop both of those names and just go by Chanel.'</li><li>I grew up listening to a lot of rap music. My dad's a DJ from Brooklyn, and he's a very soulful guy, so he always spun a lot of hip-hop, and that's where I get a lot of my hip-hop influence.</li><li>From Snoop, I've learned quite a bit. I learned that sometimes I need to keep my mouth shut. It's a long story, but definitely to sometimes keep my mouth shut. I also learned to always ignore the haters.</li><li>It's hard being a woman in this industry, period. A lot of the time, guys make you feel like you need to hook up with them - especially as an artist - producers and other artists trying to collaborate with them, they make you kinda feel sometimes you need to hook up with them or flirt with them just to make a song.</li><li>I know what it's like to have guys make you feel like you need to flirt with them or be s*xy or hook up with them or something, and you don't have to do those things. You just have to be strong and stand your ground.</li><li>Honestly, the biggest setback to my music career was people's perception that I was a reality TV star, not a rapper.</li><li>I always say that I want to be like 2Pac. If I were to die tomorrow, I want to know that I have enough music to put out for my fans for years to come.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e3e261f873bfe679.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brooks Nader modeling career, and relationship story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chanel West Coast is an artist worth her salt.
