I'm funny and sassy.' But I'm deeply sensitive. Not only about myself but to others. Not to pat myself on the back, empathy is a quality I've cultivated over my life. It came naturally to me as a child. - Laura Benanti</li><li>After 'Arrested Development,' I didn't know for sure if I wanted to be an actor. I was hitting this wall, where I was the 'ethnic best friend' or the 'sassy teenager.' It felt like the same note, and I didn't feel like I was growing. - Alia Shawkat</li><li>I don't know, I like the word sassy. - Kat Dennings</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs291hj6mlt0tg.jpeg><ul><li>I don't feel ashamed to be loud, which is an argument I've had with lots of men, who thought I was too sassy and unladylike. – SZA</li><li>I'm sassy, even though I hate that word! I'm sensitive and cry really easily. - Xosha Roquemore</li><li>When you're the only girl in a family of men, you have to be pretty sassy. - Susan Ford</li><li>Just because I'm sassy and have a mouth on me doesn't mean I'm coming from a negative place. - Kesh</li><li>I think of myself as kind of a hippy. Everyone around me says that's not the impression they get. They think I'm sassy. Apparently, I think I'm nicer than I really am. - Cecily Strong</li><li>There's so much material out there that's unnecessarily racist. It takes a shot at what is 'urban' or demonstrates blackness with some sassy, neck-jiving character that's not even relevant to the plot. I see it time and time again, and it doesn't move the story forward. It just kind of cryogenically freezes us in this old racial paradigm. Jesse Williams</li><li>There are expectations in how you play your character as a black woman, to be sassy and the same kind of feel as if there are no quirky black women. I struggle with those things constantly, trying to add dimension to my work, and that's the goal, too. - Nicole Beharie</li><li>All black women aren't sassy, loud, difficult, or subservient. We are, in fact, very complex and very diverse, living very complex and diverse lives. That point cannot be made enough. - Ava DuVernay</li><li>I fall into that nebulous, quote-unquote, normal American woman size that legions of fashion stylists detest. For the record, I'm a size 8 - this week, anyway. Many stylists hate that size because I think to them, it shows that I lack the discipline to be an ascetic; or the confident, sassy abandon to be a total fatty hedonist. - Mindy Kalin</li><li>I'm a strong person. I'm also very sassy and a little bit angsty sometimes. - Ashley Tisdale</li><li>I'm tired of playing freaking cha-chas, the sassy CIA agent, the best friend homegirl. I'm tired of that! - Melonie Diaz</li><li>The guilty pleasure I miss most when I'm out slogging on the campaign trail is the chance to sprawl on the chaise and watch a vacuously spunky and generically sassy chick flick. - Maureen Dowd</li><li>I come from a big, loud family, and I'm the quieter one. Performing is something I have to switch on. I've heard I get real sassy onstage, which I'm not in real life! It's fun to be that person for an hour a night. - Lorde</li><li>One of my personal plights in this business is about playing 'The Sassy Black Girl.' - Gabourey Sidibe</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/26851d23ad818750_w.jpeg><ul><li>I usually play grounded, has-their-head-on-straight kind of sassy girls. - Alia Shawkat</li><li>I'm really attracted to playing strong, outspoken, sassy women. And I love playing characters who have a little bit of conflict or who can be controversial. - Darby Stanchfield</li><li>My very sassy, older southern sister is very quick to point out that it's a luxury that my daughter gets to come to work with me. She does, and I have lunch with her every single day. My mom says I have 'high-class problems.' - Angela Kinsey</li><li>I never want to be too mean with my songs, but with 'I Hope It Rains' it was definitely somewhere in the middle with being sassy but also a little class in there as well. It was a good blend for me and who I want to be perceived as an artist. - Jana Kramer</li><li>Doing a song that's sassy but kind of has that little flair to it, it's very me.- Brynn Cartelli</li></ul><p class=align-left>There you have it.
