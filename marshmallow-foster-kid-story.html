For some backstory, Grace has been a foster and adoptive parent for over seven years and often posts online about raising her children.</p><p>During this particular TikTok post, Grace focused on her shopping trip to Target with Firecracker and her other daughter Violet. Grace said the Target run was to allow Firecracker to find ‚Äúoutfits, a book, and a snack‚Äù she likes without any influence from the other children in the house. When they arrived at the store, Grace told Firecracker to pick out whatever she wanted, which was a bag of marshmallows.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@one_more_arrow href=#>@one_more_arrow</a><p>I‚Äôve been a foster parent for nearly 7 years. I still can‚Äôt always predict what things will be triggers for kids who enter my home. But kindness and gentleness always go a long way. And sometimes, healing looks like choosing marshmallows for a snack just because you can‚Ä¶. and because now you know they‚Äôre soft. <a title=thisisfostercare href=#>#thisisfostercare</a> <a title=fosterlove href=#>#fosterlove</a> <a title=healing href=#>#healing</a> <a title=trauma href=#>#trauma</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Gentle and warm background piano(1262846) - Noru" href=#>‚ô¨ Gentle and warm background piano(1262846) - Noru</a></figure><p>On their way home from the shopping spree, Firecracker, who had already opened the bag of marshmallows and had begun eating them, asked Grace if she knew how versatile marshmallows could be.</p><p>‚ÄúDid you know that sometimes marshmallows is hard, and sometimes marshmallows is just marshmallows, and sometimes marshmallows is s'mores?‚Äù Grace said to the camera as Firecracker.</p><p>Grace said she asked Firecracker to explain further what she meant. She said her foster kid told her she would eat marshmallows in the home she lived in before Grace and her husband took her in. However, the marshmallows were a coping mechanism for the triggering moments she experienced in Firecracker‚Äôs former home.</p><p>‚ÄúWhen things were going on that were not safe, I'll just kind of leave it at that, she would go into the pantry, and she said she would lick the marshmallows until somebody could get her food to eat,‚Äù Grace explained in her TikTok. ‚ÄúAnd they were hard. They were hard as rocks. Because they were probably old, and she remembered that.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@one_more_arrow href=#>@one_more_arrow</a><p>Replying to @Alexis McGuire <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> an updated introduction!</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Grace üíóüíóüíôüíôüíó" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Grace üíóüíóüíôüíôüíó</a></figure><p>The foster parent continued saying Firecracker‚Äôs experience with marshmallows was so triggering she previously declined eating s‚Äômores during a family outing. The child apologized for not eating the s‚Äômore then, and Grace told her it was ‚ÄúOK‚Äù that she didn‚Äôt want to eat it.</p><p>However, when her ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù made s‚Äômores, Firecracker ate one, which is when she discovered her initial theory that ‚Äúsometimes marshmallows is hard, and sometimes marshmallows is just marshmallows, and sometimes marshmallows is s'mores.‚Äù</p><p>The sweet baby then asked Grace if she could keep the marshmallows in the bottom pantry to snack on whenever she wanted. Grace happily accepted but added a generous, considerate bonus. While placing the marshmallows in a container, Grace promised to keep Firecracker‚Äôs marshmallows fresh and soft.</p><p>‚ÄúThey won't be hard, baby girl,‚Äù Grace said as she put the stored marshmallows in the bottom pantry. ‚ÄúAnd we'll use them for s'mores.‚Äù</p><p>I‚Äôm not crying; you are!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@one_more_arrow</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The TikToker‚Äôs viewers applauded her for being the parent her foster kid deserves.</h2><p>Since Grace posted her heartfelt story of parenting done right, the TikToker has gained over 290,000 views on her video. She also received over 900 comments from viewers who praised her for showing Firecracker the love she likely didn‚Äôt have before she entered Grace‚Äôs home.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@one_more_arrow</a></figure><p>‚ÄúThe outright BRAVERY for her to choose marshmallows when she had so much trauma with them. Sweet, brave, beautiful girl,‚Äù one commenter wrote.</p><p>‚ÄúBless her heart, I‚Äôm in tears,‚Äù another said. ‚ÄúMay she never have to be in a situation like that again ever.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI'm BAWLING over here,‚Äù a third user admitted. ‚ÄúFirecracker will never have to eat hard marshmallows again.‚Äù</p><p>"God love that baby. This touched my soul. Keep doing good work, mom!" another wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@one_more_arrow</a></figure><p>Several TikTokers also shared their experiences of growing up in foster care and having food ‚Äútriggers‚Äù they didn‚Äôt realize they had until they watched Grace‚Äôs TikTok.</p><p>Hopefully, foster parents like Grace will allow the upcoming generation of foster children to exist as kids and always have fresh snacks in their pantries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zv8emmKWkn6x6p7vSrZyrZZuesW6%2F06ipsg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-it-cake-cast-instagrams.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Is it Cake?'
