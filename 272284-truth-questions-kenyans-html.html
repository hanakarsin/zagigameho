It is but a verbal game for parties where two or more people participate in a round of questions and answers. Of course, it is more than just answering a few random questions put in front of you. It is one of the most fun-filled party games you could try out with a group of friends. What makes it awesome is that you are not allowed to back down from the path you have opted for, once you have declared your choice. I thought of making things cooler for you by suggesting a crazy collection of truth or dare questions. But remember; try it at your own risk. Once you choose “truth”, you will have answer honestly to the question asked. If you choose “dare”, you are going to have to do what has been asked of you; but that cannot be decided without being in the situation. For now, try out the list of best truth or dare questions.</strong></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cb6b53cc307bb448.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ nice things to comment on your friend's post to hype them up</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cb6b53cc307bb448.jpeg><h2>Embarrassing truth or dare questions</h2><p class=align-left>Answering questions is something most of us try to ignore or avoid because it is something we do not like. You get it, do you not? Some questions can be pretty embarrassing and answering those can feel even worse. When we are talking about truth or dare, embarrassing questions play a significant role because that is what it is mainly about. It checks your party prowess and your guts. One who is able to blatantly put out the truth is the one who’s bold enough to be standing tall.</p><p class=align-left>Here are some questions to ask in truth or dare for you to shoot at your party. These will cover things from secret crushes to all the dirty secrets. Even the most barefaced person at your party will be embarrassed and uncomfortable.</p><li>If you were given two options to choose from: one where you would have to go around naked, and the other being your thoughts which would appear inside thought bubbles on top of your head and everyone could read those.

It does not matter whether you tick the boy or the girl, as long as they feel embarrassed. The reason behind such mischief is probably because everyone tries to show some standard and maintain a supreme persona in front of their partners. When we are able to break that act and drive someone towards embarrassment, it does seem really funny. Do you think the same? That makes the two of us. Let me give you a list of truth or dare question you could use on couples and watch them try hard to show as if nothing happened.</p><li>Did you ever feel like cheating on your partner?</li><li>Did you ever eat something off the floor?</li><li>Did you ever poop your pants?</li><li>Would you go beyond kissing on your first date?</li><li>What is your worst dating experience?</li><li>Imagine you have run out of toilet paper; would you seriously consider wiping yourself using the empty roll?</li><li>What do you think makes a boy/girl sexy?</li><li>Would you wear your bra on top of your shirt if you were paid Ksh 10000?</li><li>What is the size of your bra?</li><li>Do you think highly of yourself by looking at the mirror?</li><li>What is your favourite part of the body?</li><li>What is the longest time you have spent without taking a shower?</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bae71bc003a05f1e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ smack or facts questions for sisters to get to know each other</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although, I’m giving you a few good questions for truth or dare, you should know that these are not all that is to ask.

We have had many fun things for the parties. We, at Tuko, do not like to keep things unsatisfactory, because we try to be entertaining for every age group there is. I decided to bring you a list of truth or dare questions for kids. It is not wise to ask kids to play with those dirty or flirty questions; let them learn as they grow. So, if you are a kid, or you would want to set up a game for your kids, here are some fun things you could ask them to do. And they do not necessarily have to be questions because those little guys might have a hard time answering. You could also ask them for dares, if that is what they choose.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhsh3j06p7a3g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>6 tips on how to get over someone you like fast</span></p></a><li>If you were given a chance to ask for anything in this world, what would that be?</li><li>Try and lick your elbow.</li><li>Use your feet to peel a banana.</li><li>What is the weirdest dream you have ever had?</li><li>Did you ever lie to your teacher?

I got you plenty of truth or dare questions for your next party game. I’m hoping that you are smiled as you went on reading and thinking what your answer would be if all these questions were shot at you. In case you are wondering how such questions are created, let me tell you, there is no specific rules to formulate such a list. All you have to keep in mind is that your questions should not hurt anybody. Stay away from racial, religious, and cultural comments or indications. Let your questions sound fit for everybody, and keep in mind that you do not push or enforce those on anybody.</p><p class=align-left>Happy Truth or Dare!</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlmtpcWxdqb%2B2wMdmqK6do6m2sLrSZqKepqmWu7R6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./buhari-frowns-at-youths-says-no-more-job-vacancies-for-them.html>&#171;&nbsp;Buhari Frowns At Youths, Says No More Job Vacancies For Them</a>
