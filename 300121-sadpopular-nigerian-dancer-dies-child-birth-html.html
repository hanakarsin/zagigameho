The beautiful lady who was famous for dancing for several popular musicians including Pasuma, KWAM 1 and Shina Peters, died in a private hospital in Lagos two days ago, October 1st, exactly 20 days after her wedding to husband Godwin Eloanyi, which was on September 13th.</p><p>Linda Ikeji reports that friends of the deceased made it known that Kemi was in and out of labour for several days in a private hospital which made the doctor to resolve to C&S. The Cesarian operation was however said to cost N450k in which the doctor demanded an initial deposit of N300k before anything was done.</p><p>The husband who could not come up with the money immediately, begged the hospital management to carry on with the operation, promising to pay the next day (October 1st) but the hospital insisted on the deposit and refused to carry out the operation. Sadly, Kemi passed away last night.</p><p>Here is how one&nbsp;of the deceased's friends explained&nbsp;what happened to Kemi:</p><p><i>"Kemi wouldn’t have died if the doctors did pay attention to her. She was in labour for several days and was asked to pay certain amount of money before she could be operated upon. The truth is that Kemi was in labour for over one week. She tried in vain to give birth the normal way but the baby just didn’t come.</i></p><p><i>"Eventually the doctor told her she would have to go through C&S. It was termed emergency C&S. The hospital told her husband that they would have to pay a sum of 450,000 for her to be operated upon. He also said that before anything could be done they would have to make a deposit of 300,000. The husband made several efforts to raise 300,000 but deposited all he had. He begged the doctors to please go ahead with the operation and would pay before the next day. That was on October 1st , the night she died."</i></p><p><i>"Kemi's husband said he would pay the money the next day but the doctor refused and stated categorically that he would not move an inch else he pays 300,000. It was at that point Kemi decided to forward messages to people she knows so she could get help. She got responses that money would be made available to her the next day. On hearing that the husband went to beg the doctors again, still they refused. No bank was opened and nothing could be done until Thursday October 2nd but unfortunately she gave up the ghost that night. My point is, the doctors knew she had to go through emergency C&S. they could have saved her life and get the money later. &nbsp;Nigeria is a very bad country I must confess."</i> one of her friends said sadly.</p><p>It would be recalled that just recently, an actress, Ijeoma Okorie, who is a member of&nbsp; Actors Guild of Nigeria, AGN, Rivers State chapter,<a href=#> died during childbirth alongside her twin babies</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHF8kGtoZquRmb2wvNSlmKtlnp60pr7ImqVmnJGjsKa%2BjJ2gnqtdmLWquMNmmaKqpJ17qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./skc-ogbonnia.html>&#171;&nbsp;Read All The Latest News About SKC Ogbonnia On Naija News</a>
