When the series first began in the fall of 2010, Kyle and Mauricio were the epitome of "couple goals," at least to the viewers. Because of this heightened attention to their relationship, the months leading up to the news of their separation were filled with plenty of rumors about their marriage potentially coming to an end.</p><p>Rumors swirled that <a href=#>Mauricio cheated</a>, but those were soon overtaken by rumors that Kyle was also guilty of infidelity. With all the stories flying around them, the official news of their separation was not that surprising. However, <a href=#>Bravo</a> fans were still wondering why they were separating and were hoping to glean some answers from Season 13 of RHOBH. Unfortunately, they were entirely disappointed, as the topic was only touched on, if not completely ignored.</p><p>Now, Mauricio has been seen with a new woman.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Mauricio Umanksy on 'Buying Beverly Hills'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Mauricio Umansky's mysterious new girlfriend?</h2><p>Mauricio was seen embracing and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kissing a woman</a> who has yet to be identified. The duo looks to be very much enamored with each other, but outlets were unable to get a name for the time being. The blond woman appears to be younger than Umansky, but her actual age has yet to be confirmed as well. Mauricio has been photographed in a variety of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">flirtatious situations</a> with women throughout their separation, but the body language in the photos with his mystery lady makes it seem they're more than just dating.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Kyle Richards and daughter Farrah Brittany on 'Buying Beverly Hills'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What's going on with Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky's marriage and separation?</h2><p>RHOBH viewers were incredibly disappointed by the lack of insight into what was happening between Mauricio and Kyle during Season 13. It was almost entirely avoided, and fans were frustrated by what they felt was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hypocrisy from Kyle</a>, who refused to divulge the kind of information she would demand from her fellow cast members in prior seasons. Luckily, fans got a little more of what they were seeking when Season 2 of <a href=#>Buying Beverly Hills</a> debuted on <a href=#>Netflix</a> a few weeks after the RHOBH reunion.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Kyle and Mauricio on 'Buying Beverly Hills'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Kyle and Mauricio still living together?</h2><p>Kyle and Mauricio were still living together when the news of their separation broke, and they stayed in the same house for longer than most would. However, Kyle shared that Mauricio moved out of their house during a May 2024 interview with the Bitch Bible podcast. While on the podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>, "The day that he moved out was just strange because I came home and I was like, 'everything's so quiet.'‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kyle Richards and Morgan Wade were rumored to be in a relationship, and those rumors still stand.</h2><p>Another major reason fans were excited to see what happened between Mauricio and Kyle was her sudden and inexplicably close relationship with country singer <a href=#>Morgan Wade</a>, from matching tattoos to photos of them hugging in a seemingly romantic way. The topic arose during the season and also was brought up during the reunion special. Kyle continues to remain ambiguous about the nature of their relationship, and Morgan is equally evasive. Here's hoping Mauricio is more forthcoming about his new love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq62vsicoKhlpaKur7%2FKsmSgoaKhs7O1xKeb</p></div><div id=links><a href=./birth-moving-car.html>&#171;&nbsp;Woman Gives Birth to Baby No. 5 in Moving Car</a>
